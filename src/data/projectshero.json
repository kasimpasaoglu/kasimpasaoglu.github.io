The projects shared below are merely archived pages to track my progress.ðŸ“š Hopefully, as I evolve into a professional front-end developer, I'll rename the page to `References` and transform it into a space where I showcase professional projects and applications crafted in my career journey.ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€"
